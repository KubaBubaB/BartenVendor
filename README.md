# BartenVendor
Small side-project, application which tells what cocktails you can make given ingredients you have. It is a mess right now and needs a lot of polish.

You can do a few things:
1) Ingredients  
    A) Add Ingredient (Adds ingredient to container of ingredients you own)  
    B) Show Ingredients (Lists every Ingredient you own)  
    C) COMING SOON Delete Ingredient (Just like 1A but vice versa)  
    D) COMING SOON Change Quantity (Changes quantity of owned ingredient)  
2) Recipes  
    A) Add Recipe (Adds Recipe to the data base of recipes)  
    B) Show Recipe (Shows chosen recipe)  
    C) COMIN SOON Delete Recipe (Just like 1C but recipe)  
3) Available Drinks  
    A) Show me! (Shows every recipe, and tells whisch you can make and if you cannot tells what ingredients you are missing)  
4) Help  
  A) COMING SOON ???(Im planning on adding some very basic bartender guide maybe some dictionary etc.)  
  
  
There is a lot of room to exploit the nulls returned in dialogs - working on it right now :)  
Created using only Swing - it is basic library, maybe in the far future i will update the interface to something more modern
